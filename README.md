## Climatology methods

I've written a couple of example python scripts that show how I typically calculate climatologies using harmonic analysis and placed them in this repository (https://github.com/crisien/Py_examples). These scripts calculate a global SST climatology based on [100 years (1900-1999) of monthly HadISST fields](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/). These data do contain linear trends so I wrote one script that calculates a climatology while ignoring trends [hadisst_climatology_example_no_trend.py](hadisst_climatology_example_no_trend.py) and one that includes trends [hadisst_climatology_example_with_trend.py](hadisst_climatology_example_with_trend.py). Lines 67 and 91 are where I specify whether or not to include a trend. Dudley Chelton and I wrote a paper a few years ago that uses harmonic analysis ([Risien & Chelton, 2008, JPO, doi:10.1175/2008JPO3881.1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008JPO3881.1)). Section 2d discusses this method and Appendix C compares it to simply calculating long-term means for each of the 12 calendar months. One of the advantages to using harmonic analysis is that once you have calculated the regression coefficients you can save them and use them to calculate a climatology at any frequency, e.g. if you want a monthly climatology `f=1/12` or if you want a daily climatology `f=1/365`, etc, see lines 88-92. Hopefully this explains how I approach calculating climatologies.
